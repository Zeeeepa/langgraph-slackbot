# CI/CD Slack Team MCP and AI User Agent Assistant

A comprehensive solution for implementing a CI/CD Slack Team MCP and AI User Agent Assistant with advanced workflows.

## Overview

This project combines the best elements from multiple Slack bot frameworks to create a powerful CI/CD integration and AI-powered assistant for development teams.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Agent System**: AI User Agent, Repository Operator, and Assistant Agent working together
- **MCP Integration**: Support for multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq)
- **Advanced Workflow Engine**: Multi-threading and dependency management
- **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
- **Plugin System**: Extensible architecture for custom tools
- **Progress Tracking**: Automated tracking of implementation progress

## Important Documentation

- [REQUIREMENTStodo](REQUIREMENTStodo/REQUIREMENTStodo.md): **ALWAYS READ FIRST** - Contains requirements and progress tracking
- [PLANTODO.md](PLANTODO.md): Detailed implementation plan with phased approach
- [CODEGEN_PROGRESS.md](CODEGEN_PROGRESS.md): Tracks progress of each requirement implementation

## Architecture

The system is built on a multi-agent architecture with the following components:

1. **Multi-Agent System**
   - AI User Agent: Analyzes requirements, creates implementation plans
   - Repository Operator: Manages code operations and context retrieval
   - Assistant Agent: Implements solutions, manages branches and PRs

2. **MCP Integration Layer**
   - Tool registry for dynamic capability extension
   - Support for multiple LLM providers
   - Context management for repository operations

3. **Advanced Workflow Engine**
   - Phased implementation approach
   - Multi-threading for concurrent task processing
   - Dependency management for complex workflows

4. **CI/CD Integration**
   - GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
   - Branch management for feature isolation
   - PR automation and validation

## Implementation Workflow

1. **Read Requirements**: AI agent reads REQUIREMENTStodo.md first
2. **Form Implementation Plan**: Generate detailed plans for features
3. **Mark Progress**: Update progress markers in CODEGEN_PROGRESS.md
4. **Generate Code**: Implement features according to plans
5. **Save Changes**: Commit changes to appropriate branches
6. **Trigger Workflow**: CI/CD workflow tests and deploys changes
7. **Update Progress**: Mark features as completed

## Getting Started

To start implementing the system:

1. Review the [REQUIREMENTStodo](REQUIREMENTStodo/REQUIREMENTStodo.md) file to understand the requirements
2. Follow the phased implementation approach in [PLANTODO.md](PLANTODO.md)
3. Begin with the Foundation phase to get a minimal viable system
4. Track progress in [CODEGEN_PROGRESS.md](CODEGEN_PROGRESS.md)

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please follow the implementation workflow described above.
