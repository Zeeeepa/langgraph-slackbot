# CI/CD Slack Team MCP and AI User Agent Assistant

## IMPORTANT: ALWAYS READ THIS FILE FIRST

This document contains comprehensive instructions for implementing the CI/CD Slack Team MCP and AI User Agent Assistant. It outlines the requirements, architecture, and implementation plan for the project.

## Instructions

1. This document is divided into two main sections:
   - **Non-editable instructional part**: Contains project guidelines, architecture, and best practices
   - **Requirements section**: Contains specific implementation requirements with progress tracking

2. When implementing features:
   - Update the progress markers in the Requirements section
   - Follow the implementation phases outlined in the architecture
   - Use the provided workflows for development

3. All code should adhere to the following principles:
   - Modular design with clear interfaces
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Thorough documentation
   - Test coverage for critical components

## Architecture Overview

The system is built on a multi-agent architecture with the following components:

### Core Components

1. **Multi-Agent System**
   - **AI User Agent**: Analyzes requirements, creates implementation plans
   - **Repository Operator**: Manages code operations and context retrieval
   - **Assistant Agent**: Implements solutions, manages branches and PRs

2. **MCP Integration Layer**
   - Tool registry for dynamic capability extension
   - Support for multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq)
   - Context management for repository operations

3. **Advanced Workflow Engine**
   - Phased implementation approach (initialization, development, management, analysis)
   - Multi-threading for concurrent task processing
   - Dependency management for complex workflows

4. **CI/CD Integration**
   - GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
   - Branch management for feature isolation
   - PR automation and validation

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation
- Integrate langgraph-slackbot's multi-agent architecture
- Add MCP client capabilities from mcp-client-slackbot
- Set up Socket Mode for Slack integration
- Implement basic workflow engine

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
- Add CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions
- Implement project state analysis
- Add multi-threading for concurrent task processing
- Create dynamic tool registry

### Phase 3: Extensibility
- Implement plugin system for custom tools
- Add workflow definition language
- Create configuration-driven behavior system
- Add webhook integration for external systems

## Best Practices

1. **Code Organization**
   - Use clear module boundaries
   - Implement dependency injection for testability
   - Follow consistent naming conventions

2. **Error Handling**
   - Implement comprehensive error logging
   - Use structured error types
   - Provide user-friendly error messages

3. **Security**
   - Store secrets securely using environment variables
   - Implement proper authentication and authorization
   - Validate all user inputs

4. **Performance**
   - Use asynchronous processing for I/O operations
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed data
   - Monitor and optimize resource usage
