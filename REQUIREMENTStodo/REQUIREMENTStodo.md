# CI/CD Slack Team MCP and AI User Agent Assistant

## IMPORTANT: ALWAYS READ THIS FILE FIRST

This document contains the requirements and implementation progress for the CI/CD Slack Team MCP and AI User Agent Assistant. The AI agent must always read this file first before making any code changes to understand the current requirements and progress.

## Architecture Overview

![Repository Operating Agents](../RepoOperator.png)

### Core Components

1. **Multi-Agent System**
   - **AI User Agent**: Analyzes requirements, creates implementation plans
   - **Repository Operator**: Manages code operations and context retrieval
   - **Assistant Agent**: Implements solutions, manages branches and PRs

2. **MCP Integration Layer**
   - Tool registry for dynamic capability extension
   - Support for multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq)
   - Context management for repository operations

3. **Advanced Workflow Engine**
   - Phased implementation approach (initialization, development, management, analysis)
   - Multi-threading for concurrent task processing
   - Dependency management for complex workflows

4. **CI/CD Integration**
   - GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
   - Branch management for feature isolation
   - PR automation and validation

## Implementation Rules

1. **Requirement Analysis**
   - Before implementing any feature, thoroughly analyze the requirements
   - Break down complex requirements into manageable tasks
   - Identify dependencies between components

2. **Progress Tracking**
   - Update the progress markers in this file after implementing each feature
   - Use the following format for progress tracking:
     - `[✓]` for completed tasks
     - `[ ]` for pending tasks
     - `[~]` for in-progress tasks
     - Percentage indicators for module completion

3. **Code Generation Workflow**
   - Read requirements from this file
   - Form implementation plan for the requested feature
   - Mark progress in the appropriate section
   - Generate code according to the plan
   - Save changes and create appropriate branches/PRs
   - Update progress markers after completion

4. **Quality Standards**
   - All code must include appropriate error handling
   - Include unit tests for new functionality
   - Follow the established code style and patterns
   - Document all public APIs and complex logic
   - Consider security implications of all changes
