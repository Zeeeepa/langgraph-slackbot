# Multi-Threaded Agentic Slackbot Requirements

## Overview

This document outlines the requirements for a sophisticated multi-agent system for project management and document processing through Slack. The system will consist of two primary agents:

1. **AI User Agent** - Initiates requests and manages project requirements
2. **Assistant Agent** - Processes requests and implements solutions

## Functional Requirements

### Multi-Threading Architecture
- The system must support concurrent request handling
- Implement thread-safe state management
- Provide a prioritized request queue
- Support asynchronous message processing

### GitHub Integration
- Automated branch creation and deletion
- Pull request generation and management
- Merge conflict resolution
- Post-merge validation and testing

### Document Processing
- Markdown parsing for requirement extraction
- Natural language processing for requirement analysis
- Documentation generation from implementation
- Traceability between requirements and implementation

### Project Management
- Task tracking across multiple workstreams
- Dependency management between concurrent tasks
- Progress monitoring and reporting
- Resource allocation based on priority

### Slack Integration
- Seamless communication between agents and users
- Message routing and processing
- Thread-based conversation management
- Support for rich message formatting

## Technical Requirements

### Performance
- Handle up to 10 concurrent tasks
- Process messages within 5 seconds
- Complete simple implementation tasks within 10 minutes
- Support long-running tasks up to 1 hour

### Scalability
- Support multiple GitHub repositories simultaneously
- Handle multiple projects with different requirements
- Scale to support additional agent types in the future
- Support for multiple Slack workspaces

### Security
- Secure storage of API tokens and credentials
- Role-based access control for sensitive operations
- Audit logging for all operations
- Secure communication between components

### Reliability
- Graceful error handling and recovery
- Persistent state management
- Transaction-based operations
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring

## User Interface Requirements

### Slack Commands
- Add a project: `@bot add project name:myproject repo:owner/repo`
- Initialize a project: `@bot initialize project name:myproject`
- Implement a feature: `@bot implement feature X`
- Analyze project state: `@bot analyze project state`
- Check task status: `@bot what's the status of task task-123?`

### Notifications
- Task completion notifications
- Error notifications
- Progress updates
- Pull request status updates

## Integration Requirements

### GitHub API
- Repository management
- Branch operations
- Pull request operations
- Webhook integration

### Slack API
- Message sending and receiving
- Thread management
- User and channel information
- File sharing

### LLM Integration
- OpenAI API for natural language processing
- Langchain for agent orchestration
- Vector storage for document retrieval
- Prompt engineering for specialized tasks
